                            Working with Getting Things Done method requires few steps:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Every task, message, email is collected in the Inbox
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You move every item from inbox to another category:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If it's not actionable (doesn't require any action): delete it (Trash), incubate it for later (Someday) or save it in Reference</li>
                                            <li>If it's actionable, but require multiple steps, then move it to Projects</li>
                                            <li>If it's an action somebody else has to do, or can be delegate, move it to Waiting</li>
                                            <li>If it's an action for specific day, move it to Calendar, and set this tasks date</li>
                                            <li>If it's an action that should be done as soon as possible, move it to Next</li>
                                        </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If there any new projects, you should review them for actions
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    After you complete action, move it to Completed (or set GeThiDo to do it automatically)
                                </li>
                            </ol>
